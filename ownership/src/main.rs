    // The borrow checker looks at 3 kinds of permissions on their data, Read, Write and Own (These don't exist in runtime)
    // By default a variable has RO permissions on its data, if the var is anotated with `let mut` then it'd have ROW permissions.
    // Permissions are defined on paths, not just variables. A path is anythingg you can put on a left hand assignment.
    // Rust uses these permissions in it's borrow checker to find potentially unsafe code. That's the reason why the code above 
    // will not compile, as `v.push(4);` requires v to have RW permissions, since borrowing v to num removes the W permission, 
    // the compiler will throw an error since the required permissions are not found.

    // Mutable references
    // The references we've seen so far are read-only immutable references (shared references), they permist aliasing but disalow
    // mutation. We can also provide mutable access to data w/o moving it.

    println!("Vector is now: {:?}", v);                   // v -

    // When num was an immutable reference, v still had the R permission. Now that num is a mutable reference, v has lost all permissions while num is in use.
    // When num was an immutable reference, the path *num only had the R permission. Now that num is a mutable reference, *num has also gained the W permission.

    // Data must outlive all of its references
    // To achieve this, Rust removes the O permission from the referenced data, if you try to drop a value while a reference still lives
    // an error will occurr.

    // Sumary:
    // 1. All variables can read, own, and (optionally) write their data.
    // 2. Creating a reference will transfer permissions from the borrowed path to the reference.
    // 3. Permissions are returned once the reference's lifetime has ended.
    // 4. Data must outlive all references that point to it.
