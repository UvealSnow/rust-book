        let s = "hello"; // s is valid from this point on.
        // Do stuff with s ...
    } // scope is now over, s is no longer valid.

    // this will not work, string literals are immutable. We know their size at compile time, so it's directly
    // hardcoded into the executable. This makes string literals fast and efficient, but we can't mutate them.
    // let mut a = "Hello";

    let mut str = s;

    // This fails, as Rust considers s as no longer valid. The process of copying this variable is called a "move" as opposed to 
    // shallow copy because the first variable s is also invalidated. When str goes out of scope it alone will free the memory.
    // println!("{}", s);

    // Rust will never automatically perform deep copies of data. 
    // A way to get this behaviour is with the .clone() method, effectively it duplicates the data in the heap.
    // It's a way to explicitly show we're executing some arbitrary, possibly expensive code.
    // Rust has a special annotation called the 'Copy' trait. f a type implements the Copy trait, variables that use 
    // it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.

    // value goes out of scope and we add the Copy annotation to that type, weâ€™ll get a compile-time error.

    // can achieve this by passing a Reference of to the value we want to use.

    // References are a kind of non-owning pointer, they are created using the "&" operator, changing the variable type to &String (in this case),

    // The borrow checker looks at 3 kinds of permissions on their data, Read, Write and Own (These don't exist in runtime)
    // By default a variable has RO permissions on its data, if the var is anotated with `let mut` then it'd have ROW permissions.
    // Permissions are defined on paths, not just variables. A path is anythingg you can put on a left hand assignment.
    // Rust uses these permissions in it's borrow checker to find potentially unsafe code. That's the reason why the code above 
    // will not compile, as `v.push(4);` requires v to have RW permissions, since borrowing v to num removes the W permission, 
    // the compiler will throw an error since the required permissions are not found.

    // Mutable references
    // The references we've seen so far are read-only immutable references (shared references), they permist aliasing but disalow
    // mutation. We can also provide mutable access to data w/o moving it.
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];                  // v ^ RWO
    let num: &mut i32 = &mut v[2];                        // v -> , num ^ RO, *num ^ RW
    *num += 1;

    println!("The third element +1 is: {}", *num);        // v <- RWO, num - , *num -
    println!("Vector is now: {:?}", v);                   // v -

    // When num was an immutable reference, v still had the R permission. Now that num is a mutable reference, v has lost all permissions while num is in use.
    // When num was an immutable reference, the path *num only had the R permission. Now that num is a mutable reference, *num has also gained the W permission.

    // Data must outlive all of its references
    // To achieve this, Rust removes the O permission from the referenced data, if you try to drop a value while a reference still lives
    // an error will occurr.

    // Sumary:
    // 1. All variables can read, own, and (optionally) write their data.
    // 2. Creating a reference will transfer permissions from the borrowed path to the reference.
    // 3. Permissions are returned once the reference's lifetime has ended.
    // 4. Data must outlive all references that point to it.
